## Concept

A Covid themed 2.5D shooter that takes place in the human body where the player goes around parts of the body to survive by defending the body from attackers i.e. the virus.

## Overview

The game we are trying to create is a mix of a shooter and defending the objective. For gameplay we want to create an objective within a certain part of the body that the player needs to protect, the viruses have a few points they can spawn from and have an imaginary line drawn that paths them towards the objective. If the objective were to be hit it would take damage, enough damage would destroy that part and the player would lose score.

  

As for the visuals we want to create simple and cartoonish scenes like background and details spread across the map so we can create slightly more complex character models. For color palettes we are within the body so a mellow red or pink for the background making sure it won’t stand out too much. As for details such as the walls, floor and other objects in the play area, the floor would also be a static colour with minimal textures, the walls would be blood cells formed in a line, and other types of cells that are not interactable just float around the screen.

  

As of now we are preparing to create a tutorial and one stage taking place in the lungs as our first level so that we have the proper allotted time for our most important tasks which are the gameplay and visuals. We want to create an informative game that allows anyone from all ages to play it and understand what is going on, the gameplay is designed to be simple and should not take longer than a few minutes to complete the whole game. The replayability would come from different enemy spawn patterns and enemy types.

Win Condition  - Kill as many enemies as possible before the time runs out.

  

Lose Condition - The objective health bar loses all its health.

  

Progression - Elimination count or score before level timer ends.

  

UI: minimal would only have ammo and power up and the objective hp.

## Mechanics

  
  

### Shooting: 
weapons are projectiles that will have a default sprite and deal 1 damage to keep it simple.

### Abilities: 
pick-ups that are one time use and have different effects depending on which the player picks up.

### Defending: 
the objective depends on the level, and has (3) lives each enemy would deal 1 damage to it once it touches it.

## Game Elements

The game takes place in parts of the human body at the cellular level where cells are roaming around.

  

Our first level will be in the lungs and as a beginner stage it would make sense that it has an open area with rarely any tight spots and generally a simple level.

  

(Level 2)

  

### Player:

A white cell, the strongest white cell

(3) speed, 1 dmg per shot  
No health points but interacting with an enemy without the power up will knock back the player allowing the enemies to swarm the screen and player

  

### Enemies:

Normal: 2 speed 2 hp  
Fast: 4 speed 1 hp  
Big: 1 speed 4 hp
